			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I have always enjoyed shopping and curating my closet. Thrifting incredible vintage finds made me feel even more excited about clothing. Thereâ€™s something about a piece of clothing  celebrated before you that feels both special and personal.
            Seeing as consumer culture has changed with mass hauls from envirnmentally detrimentlal businesses, I felt it was important to me both personal passion wise and value wise to start a brand that encourages second hand shopping. Even if you decide to not buy from HA!, I hope you feel inspired to shop second-hand on your own accord. </p>
